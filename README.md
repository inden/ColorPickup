# How to play ##

You will roll the ball on the play ground and pick up cubes of the **same color**. 

It sounds easy but the ground is slippery and you may loose the control of your ball! 

You will win if 
- you collect all cubes of the same color in less than **1 minute**.
You will loos if
- you don't finish in one minute or
- the ball hits a cube of **different color** or 
- the ball **falls off** from the play ground more than 4 times


The player's color and cube's positions change each play.
